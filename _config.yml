I am an AI Researcher at Ola Krutrim. I completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Industrial Engineering and Management at BMS College of Engineering, Bengaluru. In 2017, I moved to Germany to pursue a masterâ€™s degree in Autonomous Systems at Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg. During my time there, I worked as a Research Assistant at Fraunhofer IPA in Stuttgart, where I contributed to developing reinforcement learning algorithms for Human-Robot Collaboration.

Alongside my research, I enjoy mentoring students at Skillslash, guiding them through the complexities of AI and Machine Learning while fostering their growth through hands-on learning and real-world applications.
