I'm an AI Researcher on a mission to make intelligent systems more *human-aligned, adaptive, and grounded in the real world*.

Right now, I work at [Ola Krutrim](https://www.olakrutrim.com/), where I explore how reinforcement learning and deep learning can enable smarter, safer, and more autonomous machines. My core focus is making AI *do less guessing and more understanding*.

My education journey started at BMS College of Engineering in Bengaluru, where I studied Industrial Engineering & Management â€” but it really took flight in Germany. During my masterâ€™s at Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg, I dove deep into autonomous systems and contributed to human-robot collaboration research at Fraunhofer IPA, Stuttgart.

Alongside my research, I enjoy mentoring students at Skillslash, guiding them through the complexities of AI and Machine Learning while fostering their growth through hands-on learning and real-world applications.
