<!-- 
Reinforcement learning is not just about rewards — it’s about decision-making under uncertainty, learning from sparse signals and navigating in complex environments.  -->

## Reinforcement Learning 
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. Instead of being told what to do, the agent tries things out, sees what works, and improves over time.

*Analogy*: Think of training a puppy. We don't explain the rules instead we reward the good behavior and ignore of gently discourage the bad ones. Over time, the puppy learns. 

### 🧠 Core Components of Reinforcement Learning

At the heart of reinforcement learning lies a simple loop — a continuous interaction between an agent and its environment, with the goal of learning from experience. The diagram below captures the core elements involved:

- 🧍 **Agent** <br>
The decision-maker. It could be a robot, a game character, or even a stock trading bot. The agent's job is to take actions based on what it observes.

- 🌳 **Environment** <br>
Everything the agent interacts with. The environment provides the context — like the game world, a factory floor, or a driving simulation.

- 🌍 **State** <br>
A snapshot of the environment at a given moment. It’s the information the agent uses to decide what to do. For example, the positions of all characters in a game, or the current speed and location of a self-driving car.

- 👣 **Action** <br>
What the agent chooses to do. Move left? Speed up? Pick up an object? Each decision affects the next state and shapes future outcomes.

- 🎁 **Reward**<br>
Feedback from the environment. If the action was good, the reward is positive. If not, it might be zero or negative. The agent’s goal is to maximize total rewards over time.

### 🎯 Real-World Analogy: A Kid Learning to Ride a Bike

Let’s make it super intuitive with a familiar example:

- **Agent** → The kid  
- **Environment** → The sidewalk or park  
- **State** → Is the kid balanced? Is there an obstacle ahead?  
- **Action** → Pedal faster, brake, turn left/right  
- **Reward** → Staying upright (positive), falling (negative), making it to the ice cream truck (very positive 🍦)

Over time, the kid **tries**, **fails**, **adjusts**, and **learns** to ride smoothly. That's reinforcement learning in action.
